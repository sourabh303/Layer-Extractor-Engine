## 2024-05-27 - [Optimize K-Means Unique Color Extraction]
**Learning:** Extracting unique colors via `np.unique(quantized_img.reshape(-1, 3), axis=0)` on the full image array is extremely slow (O(H*W)). The exact same distinct colors are already available in the `centers` array returned by `cv2.kmeans` with maximum `K` length (e.g. 12).
**Action:** Always use the known cluster centers instead of scanning the full image array when trying to find unique colors after K-Means quantization.

## 2024-05-28 - [Avoid Running K-Means on Full Array if Only Foreground is Relevant]
**Learning:** Running `cv2.kmeans` on an entire flattened image (`image.reshape((-1, 3))`) after applying a mask (where the background is black) wastes immense CPU time evaluating the massive cluster of background pixels.
**Action:** When clustering colors inside a specific foreground area, extract the pixels explicitly (`pixels = image[binary_mask > 0]`) and run K-Means *only* on that subset. Then reconstruct the image. This can yield ~40x speedups (O(W*H) -> O(N_foreground)).

## 2025-05-29 - [Optimize SkiaSharp Pixel Extraction in C#]
**Learning:** Calling `SKBitmap.GetPixel(x, y)` inside a nested loop for an entire image (O(W*H)) in SkiaSharp introduces massive method call overhead, causing significant performance degradation during large operations like PSD export.
**Action:** When extracting full-image pixel channels in C#, use `unsafe` byte pointers (`(byte*)bitmap.GetPixels().ToPointer()`) directly for known fast formats (e.g. `Bgra8888` or `Rgba8888`), or fall back to `bitmap.Pixels` (a `ReadOnlySpan<SKColor>`). This drastically reduces the overhead per pixel.

## 2025-05-29 - [Check Stride/RowBytes in unsafe SkiaSharp pixel blocks]
**Learning:** Assuming that an image buffer's `layer.Bitmap.GetPixels()` perfectly fits `width * 4` per row is dangerous. If there is padding (stride > width * 4), reading continuously as `ptr[i * 4]` will cross row boundaries incorrectly and corrupt the image.
**Action:** Always check that `layer.Bitmap.RowBytes == width * 4` before attempting a fast continuous 1D-array style unsafe pixel read, or manually step through rows via a `y` loop using `byte* rowPtr = ptr + (y * layer.Bitmap.RowBytes)`.

## 2025-05-31 - [Optimize OpenCV Spatial Operations via Bounding Box Cropping]
**Learning:** Running spatial operations like `cv2.inRange` and `cv2.findContours` on a full high-resolution image array where the actual motif occupies only a small fraction wastes significant computation.
**Action:** When performing OpenCV spatial processing on masked areas, extract the bounding box using `cv2.boundingRect(mask)`, crop the image to those dimensions before running the spatial operations, and pass the `offset=(x, y)` parameter to `cv2.findContours` to map coordinates back to the original image space. This changes processing time from O(W*H) to O(bbox_W*bbox_H).
